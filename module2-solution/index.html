                        <p>
                            Beef is rightly considered one of the most popular and healthy types of meat. 
                            However, consumers know more about it as a tasty dish than about a product that benefits the body.
                             The properties of meat depend on the age of the animal and its nutrition.
                              The benefits and harms of beef are unknown only to those who respect the cow and consider it a sacred animal.
                               And only a few know how to choose the right part of the cow to get the most out of it for health.
